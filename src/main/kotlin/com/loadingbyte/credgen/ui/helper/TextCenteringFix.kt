/**
 * All components whose UIs extend from [BasicTextFieldUI] share the same issue: when confronted with a font whose
 * height (according to FontMetrics) is odd while the component's height is even (or the other way around), they
 * vertically center the text one pixel too high in comparison to all other components (at least those used by us).
 * This not only looks bad, but also causes vertical misalignment between components by 1px under baseline alignment.
 *
 * The cause for this is simple: when computing the vertical offset of the text, they use the formula
 *     `(componentHeight - fontHeight) / 2`
 * while all other components effectively use
 *     `ceilDiv(componentHeight, fontHeight)`.
 *
 * As such, to resolve the issue, we just need to replace the former snippet with the latter in two places:
 *   - [BasicTextFieldUI.getBaseline]. As of JDK 17, the offending lines are:
 *     ```
 *     int slop = height - vspan;
 *     baseline += slop / 2;
 *     ```
 *   - [FieldView.adjustAllocation]. As of JDK 17, the offending lines are:
 *     ```
 *     int slop = bounds.height - vspan;
 *     bounds.y += slop / 2;
 *     ```
 *
 * Actually, [BasicTextFieldUI.create], which is the method that returns [View]s, can also return
 * [BasicTextFieldUI.I18nFieldView], which could be adapted in the same way but is package-protected, and [GlyphView],
 * which is very distinct and would require deeper study to fix. Both of these views are only used for bidirectional
 * text. This fix ignores both of them for now. Astoundingly however, in practice the fix seems to still work in bidi
 * cases, but we are not certain why.
 *
 * Because we do not want to manipulate the JDK's bytecode at runtime, this method instead replaces both all subclasses
 * of [BasicTextFieldUI] and [FieldView] with custom subclasses whose implementations of the offending methods replace
 * the floor division with ceil division.
